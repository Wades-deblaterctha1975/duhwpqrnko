Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Novocaine and, man, talk about mixed feelings. It’s like when you wash your favorite jeans and they weirdly smell like wet dog but also fresh laundry. That was Novocaine for me. Steve Martin as a shlubby dentist? Yes, please. But also? Seriously??? Like, how did we get here?

The first half's pretty much what you dream about when you think of going to a dentist, like the days when dream and nightmare do a weird tango together. There's this thing where you can almost smell the minty dental office air, and Laura Dern, bless her crazy little heart, is just the right amount of we’re-about-to-go-sideways. But then Helena Bonham Carter swoops in, all sorts of quirky trouble, and now it's a ride. A snuggly English-Bonnie-and-Clyde but with mouth guards and drills. Except with... what the hell, is that gothic dark comedy? Or just darkness with poorly placed slapstick? Can’t decide, maybe 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and see. 

>The ending, though, what an aneurysm. It just kinda left me feeling like I got double-booked between a therapy session and a circus. There’s a moment where Steve Martin’s eyes are doing that panic dance and you think — okay, what’s he thinking? But you never really find out! It's like they handed the script to a cat and it rolled over on the pages, bounced on a keyboard, and everyone just went, “Perfect, this is our ending.” Gotta love Hollywood logic.

def toothache(pain, confusion):
    while pain > 0 and confusion:
        pain -= 1
        confusion = not confusion
    return Novocaine feels

It’s one of those 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 where you might not even notice if you nod off for a sec because the plot might be having a nap right along with you. It's a chaotic blend of Midwestern sincerity, crime more bumbling than menace, and a painful amount of perfect smiles. Honestly, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you’re into this weirdness; it’s like a trim gone wrong — one ear’s cold and the other’s just...? Just what?

All in all, it’s chaos loosely gift-wrapped as an absurd dental horror show. Not sure if the anesthetic wore off after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 or if it never kicked in. Either way, I guess it was a night out.
